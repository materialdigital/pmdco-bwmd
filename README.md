## Acknowledgements

This ontology repository was created using the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit).
## Development
This ontology is developed using OWL and managed with the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit). To edit:
- Open `bwmd-edit.owl` (located in `src/ontology/`) in [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) or your preferred OWL editor.
- Create new entities (classes, properties) within the namespace `https://w3id.org/pmd/bwmd/`.
  - Example class ID: `https://w3id.org/pmd/bwmd/BWMD_0000001` (PREFIX is uppercase).
- Use the `Makefile` for automation:
  - `make test`: Run quality control (OWL reasoner checks, syntax validation).
  - `make refresh-imports`: Update imported ontologies (e.g., PMD Core, LOGO) with SLME extraction.
  - `make release`: Build release artifacts (full, base, etc.) in TTL/OWL/JSON formats.
  - `make update_repo`: Sync changes to the repo structure.
Quick start: After setup, edit in Protégé, commit, and push to trigger CI builds.
## Repository Structure
This repository provides the modular implementation of BWMD Ontology, developed and maintained using the [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit).
### Top-level directories
* **.github/:** GitHub configuration files, including CI workflows and templates.
* **docs/:** Documentation sources for the ontology website and user guides (optional; add as needed).
* **patterns/:** Logical patterns and SHACL shapes used to maintain consistent ontology design (optional).
* **src/:** Main development folder generated and managed through ODK.
  * **ontology/components/:** – Modular ontology components (classes, properties, axioms).
  * **ontology/bwmd-edit.owl:** – Primary editable ontology file used during development (ontology editors' version).
  * **ontology/imports/:** Extracted terms from imported ontologies (via SLME).
### Ontology versions (generated on release)
* **bwmd-full.owl/ttl:** Complete ontology with all imports and full axiomatization.
* **bwmd-base.owl/ttl:** Core entities without extended imports.
* **bwmd-simple.owl/ttl:** Simplified version with basic subclass and existential axioms.
* **bwmd-minimal.owl/ttl:** Lightweight minimal version for quick onboarding (recommended for beginners).
* **bwmd.owl/ttl:** Main ontology file contains the full version.
### Other files
* README.md, LICENSE.txt, CONTRIBUTING.md – Project overview, license, and contribution guidelines.
* imports.txt, components.txt, creators.txt – Configuration for setup (optional edits).
## Contribution
We welcome contributions to the BWMD Ontology ontology!
To get involved:
- Please use this GitHub repository's **[Issue tracker](https://github.com/materialdigital/pmdco-bwmd/issues)** to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.
- For creation of application ontologies using PMD core ontologies, we advise using the **[application-ontology-template](https://github.com/materialdigital/application-ontology-template/)**. It applies the same framework used here and mirrors the pmdco with all its modules.
- Write about your specific modeling concerns or any other discussable topics in the **[discussion forum](https://github.com/materialdigital/pmdco-bwmd/discussions)**.
- Participate in our **PMD Playground Meetings**: Our Ontology Playground, organized online every second Friday from 1-2 pm (CET), is a great opportunity to connect with developers and our proactive community to shape the PMDco. Please register via our [mailing list](https://www.lists.kit.edu/sympa/subscribe/ontology-playground?previous_action=info).
